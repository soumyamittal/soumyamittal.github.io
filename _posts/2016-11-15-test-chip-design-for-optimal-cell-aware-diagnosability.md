Summary: Rapid yield learning in a new manufacturing process via test chips is greatly enhanced with a “Design for Diagnosis” methodology. Since diagnosis is inherently a function of design, it is crucial that the design flow ensures defect-level diagnosis resolution and accuracy. This work describes an enhanced implementation methodology for the Carnegie-Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) that ensures optimal cell-aware diagnosability by design.
