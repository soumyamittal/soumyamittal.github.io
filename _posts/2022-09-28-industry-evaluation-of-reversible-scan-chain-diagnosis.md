Summary: Reversible scan chain is an architecture targeted towards improving the quality of chain diagnosis. In this scan architecture, chains are designed to shift the test data in both directions to isolate a defect. We implemented this technique in a test chip fabricated in a bleeding-edge technology node. We present the detailed evaluation method along with the silicon data and failure analysis results.
