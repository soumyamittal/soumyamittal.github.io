Orally defended my PhD thesis today!

Thesis committee: [Prof. Andrzej Strojwas](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/strojwas-andrzej.html), [Prof. Shawn Blanton](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/blanton-shawn.html), [Prof. Diana Marculescu](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/diana-marculescu), [Dr. Enamul Amyeen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enamul-amyeen-95118a10), [Dr. Yan Pan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yan-pan-2b42b26)

Summary: I have developed a logic diagnosis methodology that effectively diagnoses and classifies multiple defects in integrated circuits. In my thesis, I have proposed and demonstrated, for the first time, the use of machine learning to successfully pinpoint location and behavior of a defect.
