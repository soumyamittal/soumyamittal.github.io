Hello!

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](http://www.cmu.edu/). I work with [Prof. Shawn Blanton](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~actl) in the fields of integrated circuit test and diagnosis, and machine learning. My research interests include test of integrated circuits, modeling and (software) diagnosis of semiconductor defects, and application of machine learning to analyze silicon failure data.

I earned my bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), India in 2014. I have held an internship at [GlobalFoundries](https://www.globalfoundries.com/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.com) in the summers of 2015 and 2016, respectively.
