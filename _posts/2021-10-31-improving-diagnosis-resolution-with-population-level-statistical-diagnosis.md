Summary: In this paper, we present a diagnosis resolution improvement methodology for scan-based tests. This resolution improvement is achieved by considering the diagnosis problem at the level of a population (e.g., a wafer) of failing die instead of analyzing each failing die completely independently as has been done traditionally.
