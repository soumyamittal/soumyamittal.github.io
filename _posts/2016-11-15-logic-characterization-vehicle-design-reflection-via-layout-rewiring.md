Summary: A new method is proposed for constructing a CM-LCV that reflects the design characteristics of a product through rewiring either the entire layout or some portion thereof. Rewiring has many advantages including the transformation of an actual product front-end to a logic-based test chip that has significant transparency to failure. Consequently, this means that front-end masks from an actual product can be re-used to create an effective LCV that is both more reflective and inexpensive to fabricate.
