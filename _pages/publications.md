+ <span style="color:blue">Soumya Mittal</span>, R. D. Blanton, **"LearnX: A Hybrid Deterministic-Statistical Defect Diagnosis Methodology"**, *IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS), 2019*  
   *Brief Abstract*: This paper describes a two-phase, physically-aware diagnosis methodology called LearnX to improve the quality of diagnosis, and in turn the quality of design, test and manufacturing. The first phase attempts to diagnose a defect that manifests as a well-established fault behavior (e.g., stuck or bridge fault models). The second phase uses machine learning to build a model (separate for each defect type) that learns the characteristics of defect candidates to distinguish correct candidates from incorrect ones.

   *Brief Abstract*: Logic diagnosis can be time-consuming and produce unuseful information for further investigation of yield loss. It would therefore be desirable to have a preview of diagnosis outcomes beforehand, which helps engineers allocate diagnosis resources in a more efficient way. In this work, random forest classification and regression techniques are used to predict three aspects of potential diagnosis outcomes: existence of multiple defects, diagnosis resolution, and runtime magnitude.

+ Qicheng Huang, Chenlei Fang, <span style="color:blue">Soumya Mittal</span>, R. D. Blanton, **"Improving Diagnosis Efficiency via Machine Learning"**, *IEEE International Test Conference (ITC), 2018*  
   *Brief Abstract*: Resources can be easily wasted if diagnosis results in no meaningful information, or if the type of diagnostic result is not actionable. In this work, a methodology is developed to predict whether a fail log for a given design will result in a diagnosis outcome that is meaningful for the purpose at hand. Specifically, the aim is to predict the time required for diagnosis, and whether diagnosis produces any defect candidates, and if so, are those candidates the result of logic failure or chain failure. Random Forest classification algorithm is used for prediction.

   *Brief Abstract*: This work describes a noise-resistant approach called NOIDA (NOise-resistant Intra-cell DiAgnosis) for effectively diagnosing cell-level defects based on the analysis of the intra-cell physical neighborhoods surrounding likely defect locations. Defect behavior is derived based on the neighborhood, instead of relying on a specific fault model. Additionally, NOIDA is found to be more robust to noise in the tester response.

   *Brief Abstract*: This paper describes a generalized physically-aware methodology called PADLOC (Physically-Aware Defect LOcalization and Characterization) to improve the quality of diagnosis. PADLOC consists of (a) identifying the subnets that are more likely to correspond to the actual defect, and (b) deriving the defect behavior based on the activity of the neighborhood (i.e., nets that are physically close and logically related).

   *Brief Abstract*: Previous work on the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) has emphasized the diagnosability properties of a specific class of regular circuits called functional unit block arrays (FUB arrays). This paper describes a multiple-defect, two-level diagnosis procedure that leverages these unique properties of the FUB array to significantly improve diagnosis.

   *Brief Abstract*: A new method is proposed for constructing a CM-LCV that reflects the design characteristics of a product through rewiring either the entire layout or some portion thereof. Rewiring has many advantages including the transformation of an actual product front-end to a logic-based test chip that has significant transparency to failure. Consequently, this means that front-end masks from an actual product can be re-used to create an effective LCV that is both more reflective and inexpensive to fabricate.

   *Brief Abstract*: Rapid yield learning in a new manufacturing process via test chips is greatly enhanced with a “Design for Diagnosis” methodology. Since diagnosis is inherently a function of design, it is crucial that the design flow ensures defect-level diagnosis resolution and accuracy. This work describes an enhanced implementation methodology for the Carnegie-Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) that ensures optimal cell-aware diagnosability by design.

This work describes the state of a novel test chip design methodology that results in a test chip referred to as the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV).

   *Brief Abstract*: Prior work proposed a novel logic characterization vehicle called the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV), and an implementation flow that ensures a test chip to be product-like with near optimal testability and diagnosability. This work describes an enhanced implementation methodology for CM-LCV that not only guarantees 100% intra-cell defect testability for all standard cells but also reflects the user-specified design characteristics.
