Summary: We have developed a logic diagnosis methodology that is capable of effectively diagnosing and classifying multiple defects in integrated circuits. The unique part of this revolutionary work is the special amalgamation of the *X*-fault model to prevent logic error masking/unmasking, and machine learning to learn the hidden correlations between the diagnosis candidate and tester response.
