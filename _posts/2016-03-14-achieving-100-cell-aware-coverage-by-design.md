Summary: Prior work proposed a novel logic characterization vehicle called the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV), and an implementation flow that ensures a test chip to be product-like with near optimal testability and diagnosability. This work describes an enhanced implementation methodology for CM-LCV that not only guarantees 100% intra-cell defect testability for all standard cells but also reflects the user-specified design characteristics.
