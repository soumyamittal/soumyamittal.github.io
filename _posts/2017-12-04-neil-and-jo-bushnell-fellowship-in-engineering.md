I was selected (out of >800 students) to receive the prestigious 2017 Neil and Jo Bushnell Fellowship in Engineering by Carnegie Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University. The fellowship is awarded to a graduate student who demonstrates outstanding work in nanotechnology or electronic materials. I am ecstatic to receive the award in recognition of my accomplishments to date and the potential for continued success.

Dr. Michael L. Bushnell established the Neil and Jo Bushnell Fellowship in Engineering in 2008. Michael Bushnell earned a master of science degree in 1983 and a doctorate in 1986, both in electrical and computer engineering, from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now the College of Engineering.
