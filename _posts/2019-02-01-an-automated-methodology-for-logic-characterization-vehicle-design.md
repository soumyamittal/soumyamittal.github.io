Summary: A new product-like test chip called the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) is introduced to address the challenges facing conventional product-like test chips. The CM-LCV implements a highly testable two-dimensional array of functional unit blocks that reflects the properties of product designs, resulting in an optimized test chip for yield learning.
