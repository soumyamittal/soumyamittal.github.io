Our research is focused towards the development of advanced techniques and algorithms to improve the design, test and diagnosis of integrated circuits, and in turn, facilitate yield analysis and learning. It can be divided in three categories.

  - Multiple-Defect Diagnosis for Logic Characterization Vehicles

   *Abstract*: Previous work on the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) has emphasized the diagnosability properties of a specific class of regular circuits called functional unit block arrays (FUB arrays). This paper describes a multiple-defect, two-level diagnosis procedure that leverages these unique properties of the FUB array to significantly improve diagnosis. This custom diagnosis procedure is implemented and evaluated against commercial diagnosis using a simulated fault-injection experiment involving pairs of injected faults. Custom diagnosis is accurate in 98.2% of the simulations with resolution of at most five for 94.1% of the simulations, improving upon the commercial results of 70.7% accurate and 85.0% with the same level of resolution.
