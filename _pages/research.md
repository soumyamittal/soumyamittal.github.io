## <a name="1"></a>Logic circuit diagnosis, failure analysis and yield learning

+ <span style="color:blue">Soumya Mittal</span>, R. D. Blanton, **"LearnX: A Hybrid Deterministic-Statistical Defect Diagnosis Methodology"**, *IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS), 2019*  
   *Abstract*: Software-based diagnosis analyzes the observed response of a failing circuit to pinpoint potential defect locations and deduce their respective behaviors. It plays a crucial role in finding the root cause of failure, and subsequently facilitates yield analysis, learning and optimization. This paper describes a two-phase, physically-aware diagnosis methodology called LearnX to improve the quality of diagnosis, and in turn the quality of design, test and manufacturing. The first phase attempts to diagnose a defect that manifests as a well-established fault behavior (e.g., stuck or bridge fault models). The second phase uses machine learning to build a model (separate for each defect type) that learns the characteristics of defect candidates to distinguish correct candidates from incorrect ones. Results from 30,000 fault injection experiments indicate that LearnX returns an ideal diagnosis result (i.e., a single candidate correctly representing the injected fault) for 73.2% of faulty circuits, which is 86.6% higher than state-of-the-art commercial diagnosis. Silicon experiments further demonstrate the value of LearnX.

   *Abstract*: The goal of diagnosis is to identify defect locations and subsequently, identify the root cause so as to minimize (and ideally eliminate) the need for physical failure analysis. With advanced technology nodes, there has been an increasing number of front-end (i.e., within a standard cell) defects. Conventional diagnosis approaches typically fail to localize such defects. In addition, circuit-level noise can change the tester response in an unexpected way, and can decrease the quality of diagnosis. This work describes a noise-resistant approach called NOIDA (NOise-resistant Intra-cell DiAgnosis) for effectively diagnosing cell-level defects based on the analysis of the intra-cell physical neighborhoods surrounding likely defect locations. Defect behavior is derived based on the neighborhood, instead of relying on a specific fault model. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NOIDA using a library of standard cells. The results show that for over 16,000 static and sequence-dependent defects, the method achieves an average resolution improvement of 12.1% over prior work with a small accuracy loss (specifically, 1.6%). Additionally, NOIDA is found to be more robust to noise in the tester response. Specifically, in the presence of noisy tester response, NOIDA attains an accuracy of 97.6% with an average resolution improvement of 48.6% over prior work.

   *Abstract*: Logic diagnosis is a software-based methodology to identify the behavior and location of defects in failing integrated circuits, which is an essential step in yield learning. However, diagnosis can be time-consuming and produce unuseful information for further investigation of yield loss. It would therefore be desirable to have a preview of diagnosis outcomes beforehand, which helps engineers allocate diagnosis resources in a more efficient way. In this work, random forest classification and regression techniques are used to predict three aspects of potential diagnosis outcomes: existence of multiple defects, diagnosis resolution, and runtime magnitude. Experiments on a 28nm test chip and a 90nm high-volume manufactured chip prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology - high accuracy for multiple defect (up to 0.86 accuracy and 0.93 AUC) and resolution prediction (up to 0.84 accuracy and 0.87 AUC), and over 98% of the runtime magnitude prediction is within the error of one magnitude. These results prove that the method can provide helpful information to guide prudent allocation of diagnosis resources.

   *Abstract*: Logic diagnosis, the process of identifying and locating possible defects in failing integrated circuits, is a key step in yield learning for both technology development and high-volume manufacturing. However, resources can be easily wasted if diagnosis results in no meaningful information, or if the type of diagnostic result is not actionable. It would therefore be very beneficial to have a comprehensive preview of diagnostic outcomes beforehand, which allows diagnosis resources to be prioritized in a more reasonable and effective way. In this work, a methodology is developed to predict whether a fail log for a given design will result in a diagnosis outcome that is meaningful for the purpose at hand. Specifically, the aim is to predict the time required for diagnosis, and whether diagnosis produces any defect candidates, and if so, are those candidates the result of logic failure or chain failure. Random Forest classification algorithm is used for prediction. Experiments on a 28nm test chip and a high-volume 90nm part illustrate that the methodology can provide accurate prediction results (0.95+ precision, 0.9+ recall and F1-score, and 0.96+ AUC on average) when two classes are balanced, and satisfactory results (0.95+ recall and 0.98+ AUC on average) when two classes are imbalanced.

+ Ben Niewenhuis, <span style="color:blue">Soumya Mittal</span>, R. D. Blanton, **"Multiple-defect diagnosis for logic characterization vehicles"**, *IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS), 2017*  
   *Abstract*: Previous work on the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) has emphasized the diagnosability properties of a specific class of regular circuits called functional unit block arrays (FUB arrays). This paper describes a multiple-defect, two-level diagnosis procedure that leverages these unique properties of the FUB array to significantly improve diagnosis. This custom diagnosis procedure is implemented and evaluated against commercial diagnosis using a simulated fault-injection experiment involving pairs of injected faults. Custom diagnosis is accurate in 98.2% of the simulations with resolution of at most five for 94.1% of the simulations, improving upon the commercial results of 70.7% accurate and 85.0% with the same level of resolution.

   *Abstract*: Continued scaling of semiconductor fabrication processes has made achieving yield targets increasingly difficult. The design and fabrication of various types of test vehicles is one approach for enabling fast yield learning. Recent work introduced the Carnegie Mellon logic characterization vehicle (CM-LCV). The CM-LCV design methodology uses regularity and existing testability theory to produce logic-based designs that are both highly testable and diagnosable. For the CM-LCV to be effective for yield learning, it must reflect the design characteristics of actual product layouts. Previous work enables incorporation of a standard-cell distribution derived from product designs into an LCV while simultaneously ensuring optimal testability. In this work, a new method is proposed for constructing a CM-LCV that reflects the design characteristics of a product through rewiring either the entire layout or some portion thereof. Four different approaches for rewiring are examined, and the results of each approach are evaluated using a variety of metrics. Experiment results reveal that a product layout can be easily rewired to construct an LCV with reasonable wirelength with reasonable CPU time. Rewiring has many advantages including the transformation of an actual product front-end to a logic-based test chip that has significant transparency to failure. Consequently, this means that front-end masks from an actual product can be re-used to create an effective LCV that is both more reflective and inexpensive to fabricate.

   *Abstract*: Rapid yield learning in a new manufacturing process via test chips is greatly enhanced with a “Design for Diagnosis” methodology. Prior work on logic-based test chip design demonstrated an implementation flow that ensures 100% intra-cell fault coverage using a minimal test set. However, testability alone does not guarantee good diagnosability. Since diagnosis is inherently a function of design, it is crucial that the design flow ensures defect-level diagnosis resolution and accuracy. This work describes an enhanced implementation methodology for the Carnegie-Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) that ensures optimal cell-aware diagnosability by design. Experiments comparing intra-cell defect diagnosability of the CM-LCV and various benchmark circuits demonstrate the efficacy.

   *Abstract*: A comprehensive investigation of new integrated circuit design and fabrication technologies is crucial for yielding reliable parts. Prior work proposed a novel logic characterization vehicle called the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV), and an implementation flow that ensures a test chip to be product-like with near optimal testability and diagnosability. This work describes an enhanced implementation methodology for CM-LCV that not only guarantees 100% intra-cell defect testability for all standard cells but also reflects the user-specified design characteristics. Experiments comparing intra-cell defect testability between a CM-LCV and various benchmark circuits demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. Specifically, the CM-LCV achieves 92.4% overall input pattern fault coverage and 100% cell-aware fault coverage using an optimal, minimal test set.
