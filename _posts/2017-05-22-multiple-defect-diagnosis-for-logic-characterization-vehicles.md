Summary: Previous work on the Carnegie Mellon Logic Characterization Vehicle (CM-LCV) has emphasized the diagnosability properties of a specific class of regular circuits called functional unit block arrays (FUB arrays). This paper describes a multiple-defect, two-level diagnosis procedure that leverages these unique properties of the FUB array to significantly improve diagnosis.
