I presented this paper at the VLSI Test Symposium (VTS), 2018.

Summary: This work describes a noise-resistant approach called NOIDA (NOise-resistant Intra-cell DiAgnosis) for effectively diagnosing cell-level defects based on the analysis of the intra-cell physical neighborhoods surrounding likely defect locations. Defect behavior is derived based on the neighborhood, instead of relying on a specific fault model. Additionally, NOIDA is found to be more robust to noise in the tester response.
